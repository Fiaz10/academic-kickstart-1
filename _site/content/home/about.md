# **Biography**

I'm Sid, and somehow i'm already a junior at The University of Texas at Dallas (UTD). I'm currently a member of the [Advanced Network Research Lab](https://anrlutdallas.github.io/), and also works with Prof. Nicholas Ruozzi on various research projects related to machine learning. 

In my free time, I enjoy reading about recent developments in computational go (LeelaZero, MiniGo), practicing classical piano, cooking, or getting involved on campus.


## **News**
* (5/1/2019) I will be spending the summer at Johns Hopkins [Applied Physics Labs](https://www.jhuapl.edu/), doing machine learning research with their Machine Perception group. Glad I passed the clearance process!

# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "We introduce a convex function approximator that has provable convergence in Q-learning, a highly applicable model for reinforcement learning. We present our results on a variety of reinforcement learning tasks, and show promising initial results when compared to naively-built “Input Convex Neural Networks”."

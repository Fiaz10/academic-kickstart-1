# **Biography**

I'm Sid, and somehow I am already a junior at The University of Texas at Dallas (UTD). I am a member of the [Advanced Network Research Lab](https://anrlutdallas.github.io/), and also work with Prof. Nicholas Ruozzi on various research projects related to machine learning and optimization.

In my free time, I enjoy reading, catching up on developments in computational go (LeelaZero, MiniGo), [practicing classical piano](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yH61fMrFpGs), cooking, or [getting involved on campus](https://www.acmutd.co/team.html).


## **News**
* (7/20/2019) Our paper "[DeepPR](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.11533)" was accepted at IEEE Globecom 2019.
* (5/1/2019) I will be spending the summer at Johns Hopkins [Applied Physics Labs](https://www.jhuapl.edu/), doing machine learning research with their Machine Perception group.
